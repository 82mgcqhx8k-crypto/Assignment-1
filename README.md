Password Generator


Purpose
  
    To make a robust random password generator,the user is given a choice if they want to create a memorable or random password. Each option was unique and had its own purpose. With the memorable route, you decide number of words you want (the words come from a provided list of fruits, which are used as your memorable words) in your password along with that it concenates and adds one random digits for each word given. Now, for the random password section, you have to give a length, if you want any special characters, and if you want to exclude any characters. In all, purpose was to ask the user for the type of password they want to generate

  Input/Output
    
      Inputs: first asking user for what type of password they want (memorable or random), if memorable is chosen, ask user for how many words they want to appear in their password, if random is selected, then the user selects how long their password is going to be, any puncatations or special characters, and if they want to exclude any type of characters. Once that is done you can get the desired results.
    
      Outputs: fairly simple, gives the user their desired password (memorable or random) store every user's passwords in a separate file like memorable has its own file and random as well. In each of the files, you can see all your passwords created and what day, month, year, and what time you created that password.
